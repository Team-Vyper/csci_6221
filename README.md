NFT Marketplace

The purpose of this marketplace is to allow the buying and selling of NFTs on Ethereum's Virtual Network. This is done through the use of Vyper smart contracts and  Interplanetary File System (IPFS) as well as MetaWallet integration. 

This Marketplace can be viewed without a crypto wallet, but to get actual use out of the website, a user will need to connect their wallet. In order to connect a wallet, a user needs to have MetaMask as an extension in their browser. Once this setup is done, the user will be able to get the most out of our marketplace.

This marketplace depends on ether, so in order to buy or sell an NFT, a user will need ether in their wallet. To upload an NFT, a user will need to provide a name, description, price, and file for the NFT image. To list the NFT (i.e. deploy the contract), the user will need to pay a gas and transaction fee. Once those are paid, they will have to wait for the NFT to upload to our file storage, Pinata, and after that, their NFT has been listed. 

To buy an NFT, a user should first navigate to the Marketplace tab. Once there, they can select on the NFT they want to buy and pay for it.
